ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m **brokcat** â€” a passionate **lover** and **enjoyer** of everything related to **digital forensics**.

Currently a student at **Ã‰cole 2600**, I dive deep into the art of uncovering hidden truths through technical analysis, solving puzzles left by cyber attackers. Forensics is not just a field to me; itâ€™s a fascination. Alongside that, I actively immerse myself in **incident response**, **malware analysis**, and **threat hunting**â€”areas I truly enjoy mastering to fight complex cyber threats head-on.

  

## My Engagement with CyberDefenders

  

As my passion for hands-on cybersecurity grew, I became a **Challenge Maker** on the **CyberDefenders** platform. I absolutely enjoy creating challenges that blend realistic attack scenarios with gamification â€” making learning dynamic, practical, and exciting. CyberDefenders stands out for me because it delivers immersive challenges that push both technical skills and critical thinking, exactly the kind of environment I love to contribute to.

I take pride in designing challenges that feel authentic and challenging, helping the community level up their skills. Moving forward, I plan to expand my creations onto other platforms too, continuing to share my passion and connect with the wider cybersecurity world.
